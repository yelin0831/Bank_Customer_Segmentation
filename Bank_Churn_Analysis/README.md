# Bank Churn Analysis üè¶

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn for a bank. By identifying key factors that lead to customer attrition, the bank can develop effective strategies to retain high-value customers.

---

## üìä Project Goals
- **Identify** the main factors influencing customer churn (e.g., balance, credit score, tenure).
- **Develop** predictive models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest) to classify whether a customer is likely to churn.
- **Provide** actionable insights to reduce churn and improve customer satisfaction.

## üß± Dataset Info
- **Rows (Records):** e.g., 10,000
- **Columns (Features):** e.g., 15
- **Key Features:**  
  - Customer ID, Credit Score, Geography, Gender, Age  
  - Tenure, Balance, Number of Products, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember  
  - EstimatedSalary, Exited (churn label), etc.

*(Adjust to your actual dataset.)*

## üîç Analysis Steps
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handle missing values, outliers, and data types  
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., Geography, Gender)

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Examine distributions of key features (Age, Balance)  
   - Compare churn vs. non-churn customers  
   - Visualize patterns using plots and charts

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Create new features (e.g., average monthly balance, activity rate)  
   - Scale or normalize features if necessary

4. **Modeling**  
   - Apply multiple models (logistic regression, random forest, XGBoost, etc.)  
   - Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation  
   - Evaluate metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC AUC

5. **Model Evaluation & Selection**  
   - Compare performance of different models  
   - Analyze confusion matrix, ROC curve, feature importance

6. **Insights & Recommendations**  
   - Summarize key drivers of churn  
   - Suggest retention strategies for high-risk segments

## üß† Tools & Technologies
- **Python**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Jupyter Notebook / VSCode**: for development
- **Git/GitHub**: for version control and project sharing

*(Feel free to update the tools as needed.)*
